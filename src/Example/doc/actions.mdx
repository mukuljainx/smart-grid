# Grid Actions

<br />

To access grid actions you need store them in a variable by passing a callback as prop `getGridActions` which is called by the Grid in its `constructor` and public methods are passed to it which is currently limited to `refreshRows`.

```
<Grid
  {...rest}
  getGridActions={
    (gridActions) => {this.gridActions = gridActions}
  }
/>

```

<br />

### refreshRows

<TagGroup>
  <Tag color="blue">(numbers[]) => void</Tag>
</TagGroup>
<br />

On manipulating the data this function should be called with the indexs with changed the data as to increase the performance row heights are cached and there is no way grid can know when to clear the cache, so user will have to call it after required changes are being done, this clears the cache for given rows and re-renders the grid.

```
  ...
    this.gridActions.refreshRows([2]);
  ...
```

<Divider />
