Though might never need to use them, they are exposed as core.

```js
import { core } from '@crafts/smart-grid';

core.useVerticalScroll;
core.useHeight;
core.useScrollSync;
core.useActions;
```

`useGrid` and `useGrids` is nothing but combination of these hooks working together.

### useVerticalScroll

`useVerticalScroll` provides two things `onScroll` and `visible`, `visible` is the index of first visible row.

### useHeight

`useHeight` maintains the height and position of each row and table.

### useScrollSync

`useScrollSync` to maintain scroll sync between header, footer and body in case of `useGrids`

### useActions

`useActions` collection useful of actions like scrollToRow, clear, getRowPosition.
