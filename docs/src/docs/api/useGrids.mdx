title: Use Grids
description: Another Grid API
---

You must have seen two or more sections of grid having their own horizontal scrollbar but synced
vertical scroll. `useGrids` is created to the same thing but allowing developer to customize it extensively.

These grids are little special as unlike normal grid there is a lot is going on.
`useGrids` provides a lot of handler to enable this.

There will be wrapper to solve the common use case, for now there is example doing the
same and can be used to develop on top of it.

`useGrids` takes two param, `number` & a `object`. The later same prop as [`useGrid`](/api/useGrid).

## Usage

```jsx
const {
  onScroll,
  rowRenderers,
  gridHeight,
  horizontalSync,
  headerRef,
  bodyRef,
  gridRef,
  actions,
  GridHeaders,
  GridBodies,
  ScrollBars,
} = useGrids(3, {
  data: loading.current ? data.concat([null, null]) : data,
  rowHeight: rowHeight || 39,
  buffer,
  limit,
  dynamicHeight: true,
  loadMore: getData,
});
```

The hooks return couple of useful handles and calculated properties let's go through each of it

| Props          | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | Required |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| onScroll       | Scroll handler to attached with scroll able body of grid.                                                                                                                                                                   | true     |
| rowRenderer    | It's a function which expects a function to return a React.Node (the row), it provides (row,style,index,ref) where row is data[index]. For more checkout.                                                                   | true     |
| gridHeight     | Total height of scroll able part of grid, in case of virtualized grid height is dynamic especially in case of dynamic row height, this property is exposed so you can apply on scroll able part to have proper height.      | false    |
| gridRef        | ref to be attached to scroll able part, the main wrapper. Required for actions.                                                                                                                                             | false    |
| headerRef      | An array of refs, as grid can have multiple headers, ref need to be attached in order                                                                                                                                       | false    |

| footRef        | An array of refs, as grid can have multiple footer, ref need to be attached in order, this is mean to fake scrollbar below each body.                                                                                       |          |
| horizontalSync | Horizontal sync handler, need to be attached on each header, body and footer.                                                                                                                                               |          |
| GridHeaders    | A ready to use Header wrapper, no need to attach ref or scrollHandler.                                                                                                                                                      |          |
| GridBodies     | A ready to use Body wrapper, no need to attach ref or scrollHandler.                                                                                                                                                        |          |
| ScrollBars     | A ready to use Footer wrapper, no need to attach ref or scrollHandler.                                                                                                                                                      |          |
| actions        | actions is collection of useful methods like scrollToRow, getRowPosition & clear. The first two are self explanatory, clear is to be used when row of height changes, clear that index so grid can re-calculate everything. |          |

### Ref's and the wrappers

When there are more than one grid generally one (or) more are pinned and can have their own scroll, let say you have 3 grids and 2 are on
each side with 2 column but only have width of 1 column and the middle is consist of 6 columns but had width of 3 columns. This means
each is horizontally scroll able but this should also remain vertically sync else, it can't behave as a single grid. There are two ways to keep them vertically synced.

1. Keep the scroll able bodies inside one div.
2. Attach a custom onScroll handle to both, don't forget to call the `useGrids` `onScroll` from it.

2nd one can cause sync issue on heavy tables and table might go out of sync while 1st one is tricky to create but will cause no performance issue
as no JS involved for that part. But with 2nd option you can skip all **extra** refs in `useGrids` as well as wrapper. But for first one we have solved a
issue but created another which is also solved through JS but doesn't hamper the performance that much.

With 1st case, table bodies will inside a div and header will live outside now obviously in this case, if you will scroll a body header will not be scrolled
to do that all the `refs` and `horizontalSync` comes into the picture. Wrapper are just a `div` pass any children to it, the benefit is `refs` and `horizontalSync`
are already attached so you don't need to import them until you don't want `div`'s.

You can go with 2nd one if your table are light and can use throttle to prevent sync issues. Example will be added soon.
For 1st approach check the example below.

There might be 3rd way too, this is power of React Hooks and Smart Grid, do it in your own way!

Still confused with 1st approach? Don't worry it is confusing, check the example below on CodeSandbox, that will definitely help.
Example with 2nd approach will be added soon.

### Performance

Obviously the performance will not be same as `useGrid`, only little lower, as there will multiple `rowRenderer` (for each sub table) call and then horizontal syncs.
Horizontal syncs doesn't matter much as they always have limited scope and it doesn't occur along with vertical.

Multiple `rowRenderer` cannot be avoided, the thing is here it is happening in front of you, this can
be hidden from developer by taking a schema, but at some point there will be multiple calls. Same
happened with V1.0.0 just behind the scene.

Don't worry it has been battle tested with very UI intensive rows at [InnovAccer](http://innovaccer.com/).
