## Why the vertical scroll bar is not always visible?

This is how HTML works, the body got it's own height and vertical scrolling, you can make it
visible by applying to body

```css
width: 100%;
overflow-x: auto;
```

but this will make header out of sync which again can achieved by having a custom scroll handler
attached to body, something like

```jsx
<tbody onScroll={(event) => {
    // sync header position
    headerRef.current.scrollLeft = event.target.scrollLeft;
    // call the useGrid onScroll handler
    onScroll(event);
}}>
    ...
</tbody

```

a scroll handler should be also attached to header but **useGrids** `onScroll`, should not be called from there,
as `scrollTop` will zero for header element and that will scroll the table to top!

Don't worry this will not hamper the performance as both scroll can't be called together and horizontal scrollbar
will always have a limited scope.
